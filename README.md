This app is made using RecyclerView and custom itemlayout.
The itemLayout consists of Item's image, title and description.
A customAdapter using Recycler.Adapter class is used to link the 
data to the each item and then set upon to the RecyclerView.
Each view in the RecyclerView have a onClick which unlike the ListView and GridView 
there is no in-built method to utilize for which an interface is used and implemented 
on the MainActivity which provides a Toast msg when clicked upon any item.
